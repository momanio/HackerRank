Objective

Today, we're practicing bitwise operations. Check the attached tutorial for more details.

Task

We define  to be a sequence of distinct sequential integers from  to ; in other words, . We want to know the maximum bitwise AND value of any two integers,  and  (where ), in sequence  that is also less than a given integer, .

Complete the function in the editor so that given  and , it returns the maximum .

Note: The  symbol represents the bitwise AND operator.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of function calls.
Each of the  subsequent lines defines a dataset for a function call in the form of two space-separated integers describing the respective values of  and .
